## Installation

To get started, you need to set up a Python 3.7 environment and install the required libraries. Follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/zeeza18/Movie-Recommendation-System.git
    cd Movie-Recommendation-System
    ```

2. **Create a virtual environment:**
    ```bash
    python3.7 -m venv env
    ```

3. **Activate the virtual environment:**
    - On Windows:
        ```bash
        .\env\Scripts\activate
        ```
    - On macOS and Linux:
        ```bash
        source env/bin/activate
        ```

4. **Install the required libraries:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

Once the environment is set up and libraries are installed, you can run the application using Streamlit:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
